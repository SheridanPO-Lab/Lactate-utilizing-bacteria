## HMMER-based functional characterisation of lactate utilization genes
Lactate utilization loci were searched for using the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profiles of conserved domains found in three-component L-lactate hydrogenase (PF02754, PF02589, PF13183, PF11870), FAD-dependent D-lactate dehydrogenase (PF01565, PF02913, PF09330, PF12838, PF02754), FMN-dependent L-lactate dehydrogenase (PF01070, PF00173), NAD-dependent D-lactate dehydrogenase (PF00389, PF02826), NAD-dependent L-lactate dehydrogenase (PF02866, PF00056), lactate permease (PF02652), lactate racemase (PF09861) and ETF (PF00766, PF01012) using hmmsearch in HMMER3.

## BLASTP-based functional characterisation of marker genes for short-chain fatty acid pathways
The presence of short-chain fatty acid pathways involved in the production of butyrate and propionate were predicted by querying genome sequences against a database of marker genes. Butyrate kinase and butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase were used as indicators of butyrate production, and propanediol utilization protein (PduP), lactoyl CoA dehydratase alpha-subunit (LcdA) and methyl-malonyl-CoA decarboxylase alpha-subunit (MmdA) as indicators of propionate production through the propanediol, acrylate and succinate pathways, respectively. A strict threshold of 60% identity was used.
