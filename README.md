# Lactate-utilizing-bacteria

Lactate utilization loci were searched for using the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profiles of conserved domains found in three-component L-lactate hydrogenase (PF02754, PF02589, PF13183, PF11870), FAD-dependent D-lactate dehydrogenase (PF01565, PF02913, PF09330, PF12838, PF02754), FMN-dependent L-lactate dehydrogenase (PF01070, PF00173), NAD-dependent D-lactate dehydrogenase (PF00389, PF02826), NAD-dependent L-lactate dehydrogenase (PF02866, PF00056), lactate permease (PF02652), lactate racemase (PF09861) and ETF (PF00766, PF01012) using hmmsearch in HMMER3.
